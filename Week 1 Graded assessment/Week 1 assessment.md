Question 1

Once you have learned the basics of a programming language, how does this affect your ability to learn and use a second programming language?"

**1 / 1 point**

You should only code in one language.

The syntax and semantics will be the same.

It’s difficult to learn and use a second language.

It’s easier to learn and use a second language.

**Correct**

**2.**

Question 2

Which of the following are true about programming languages? Select all that apply.

**0.5 / 1 point**

Similar to human language, programming languages use syntax and semantics.

**Correct**

Programming languages are used to write computer programs and scripts.

Programming languages is a synonym for pseudocode. 

Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and R.

You didn’t select all the correct answers

Question 3

What is automation?

**1 / 1 point**

The inputs and outputs of a program 

The process of replacing a manual step with an automated step

The rules of a programming language 

The process of designing a solution to a problem

Question 5

What is a property of Python that makes it easier to understand than some other programming languages?

**1 / 1 point**

Python doesn’t have a defined syntax.

Basic guidelines can be given and it will write the code.

You can use Python code in any other language.

Code is similar to the English language.

**Correct**

**6.**

Question 6

Complete the code so that the string "I am writing Python code!" will print to the screen. Remember that syntax precision is important in programming languages. A missing capital letter, spelling error, or punctuation mark can produce errors. 

# Replace the blanks with the correct code and syntax:

print("I am writing Python code!")

# Should print: I am writing Python code!

**Correct**

Correct.

**7.**

Question 7

What should be the output of the expression below?

print((6-2)/(5\*(1+4))+3)




3\.16

5\.0

12\.0

50\.0

**Correct**

**8.**

Question 8

Keeping in mind there are 86400 seconds per day, write a program that calculates how many seconds there are in a week, if a week is 7 days.  Print the result to the screen. Note: Your result should be in the format of just a number, not a sentence.

# Enter code here:

print(86400\*7)

# Should print 604800

**Correct**

Correct.

**9.**

Question 9

Use Python to calculate how many different passwords can be formed with 6 lower case English letters (excludes any character not found in the English alphabet). For a 1 letter password, there would be 26 possibilities. For a 2 letter password, each letter is independent of the other, so there would be 26 times 26 possibilities. Using this information, print the amount of possible passwords that can be formed with 6 letters.

# Enter code here:

print(26\*26\*26\*26\*26\*26)

# Should print 308915776

**Correct**

Correct.

**10.**

Question 10

Consider this scenario about using Python to make calculations: On a college campus, there are 30 computers in each of the 20 computer labs that are spread across campus. The computers have a life cycle where they are replaced every 5 years, with an equal number (one-fifth) of the computers replaced each year. 

Fill in the blank to compute the number of computers that are replaced each year. Note: Your result should be in the format of just a number, not a sentence.

total\_computers = 30\*20

replacement\_cycle = 5

computers\_per\_year = 120.0

print(computers\_per\_year) # Should print 120.0

**Correct**

Correct.
